# PSBerry

A WIP project for Raspberry Pi, which turns a compatible RPI device into a smart USB drive for PS4/PS5.
Allows for save management of PS4 games (done), and automatically uploading clips and screenshots over the network (not done).
On top of that, it provides a web interface for managing content on the device.

In-depth description, UI overview and installation guide coming when project is done.
